# Instructions for creating a new release

* Update Readme with any new information, as needed
* Commit to git with the message `v{num}`, like `v1.4.0`, push
* Make a new release in Github
    * Add release notes based on the changes (best to use "Generate Release Notes" in the UI)
* It will automatically push the new version to PyPI, using GH Actions
* Conda forge will automatically pick up the new version from PyPI within a day or 2, and it automatically create a PR there
